# Asheville School

Location: The town of Asheville  is a small, vibrant city surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains. The 300-acre campus is idyllic – it is on the National Register of Historic Places, and the chapel is frequently used for wedding during the summer. A regional airport provides easy access to Asheville – Charlotte is two hours’ drive and Atlanta is three hours away.

Community: Asheville is a relatively small boarding school with a strong sense of community and values. It’s also a non-denominational Christian school - the entire student body meets several times a week for chapel services and chapel talks. The head of school, Arch Montgomery, is known for being very accessible to students and parents.

Student body: Asheville has alumni in 50 states and 35 countries, but the majority of students come from the south-east. Roughly half stay in the south-east for College - the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alone admits a quarter of Asheville’s graduates.

Activities: Asheville is perfect for those who love the outdoors. All students go on at least one overnight camping trip in the first year. The school has an equestrian program and a mountaineering program Riding lessons at all levels are available – either on school-owned or student-owned horses. The mountaineering program includes mountain biking, hiking, rock climbing, whitewater kayaking, ice climbing, skiing and caving. According to one student - “The Mountaineering Program is something everyone should do”.

Academics: The curriculum is rigorous – 18 AP courses are offered and a handful of students take as many as 10 APs. The school has a distinctive approach to humanities. The four year sequence of courses comprises Ancient Studies, World Studies, European Studies, and American Studies. Each course integrates literature, history, religion, art, and music. For example, when learning about the Jazz Age, students read the Great Gatsby, study 1920s art, history, and music, and visit the Grove Park Inn, where the Fitzgeralds frequently stayed.

Admission: Despite being less well known than many schools, Asheville is hard to get into – the acceptance rate is only 40%.

# Avon Old Farms School

All-boys: Avon is an all-boys school. There are a number of activities with Avon’s sisters schools - Miss Porter’s and Ethel Walker. Thiese includes theatre productions, social events and community services activities.

Athletics: Avon has an excellent athletics program - many would rate it the best boarding school for athletics. Although it counts NHL, NFL and MLB players among its alumni, it is best known for hockey. John Gardner - associate headmaster, math teacher, and hockey coach – has built up a phenomenal track record with the Avon team. He has set a record for the most wins in prep school history (over 700), has coached the team to 8 New England Championship wins, and has helped two players achieve Olympic success.

Service: The school believes strongly in community service. Students are involved with organizations like the Special Olympics, American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. Students who perform more than 20 hours of service in a given year are awarded a community service rosette. As a member of faculty, a former U.S. Marine, explained - “Avon does a great job of promoting the concept of service without forcing it upon our students. Giving really is better than receiving and the sooner our students realize that, the happier and more fulfilled they will be.” Every year, several Avonians go on to attend one of the military academies.

Curriculum: Between the first and second semesters, students focus on one topic for two weeks. These “intersession” courses typically include excursions, experiential learning, and interdisciplinary work. At the end of the program, each class presents what they have learned to the wider community. Courses have included aviation, songwriting, genomics, and the business of sports.

Post-grads: Avons accepts 15-20 post graduates every year, who take an extra year between high school graduation and college matriculation. Often, the reason for the extra year is to experience an extra year of athletics before moving on to college sports.

Academic Support: Brewster has a student population with a range of abilities – some take AP classes, while others need significant academic support. So that each student can be challenged appropriately, there are three leveled groups within each class – foundational, standard, and accelerated. In addition, three levels of academic support are available: Transition Assistance Plan, Instructional Assistance Plan, and Comprehensive Skill Plan. Within the Transition Assistance Plan, students and teachers meet weekly to review progress and provide the student with feedback. At the next level, the Instructional Assistance Plan, there are two sessions per week, focused on accelerating development of a core skill which is critical to success. The Comprehensive Skill Plan includes three sessions per week to provide frequent, ongoing, intensive assistance to develop multiple skill sets.

Emotional Intelligence: Brewster has a number of skills-based programs that promote emotional and social development. The curriculum was developed in partnership with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. By demonstrating respect, integrity, and service, students can achieve Citizenship or John Brewster Scholar recognition.

I couldn't help but see myself eventually doing the same thing. I wouldn't trade this experience for the world.”

# Cate School
    
Location: Cate’s location is hard to beat – the campus sits between the mountains and the beach, and the town of Carpinteria has a charming main street. Some dorms even have a balcony and a view of the ocean. Santa Barbara is only fifteen minutes to the North, and LA is ninety minutes to the South.

Outdoor activities: Students have the opportunity to go surfing, kayaking, mountain biking, rock climbing, stand-up paddle boarding, and hiking.

Students can also focus on studio art or participate in a theatre production in the fall.

Admissions: Despite being less well known than some of the big name East Coast schools, Cate is in the same league – academics are rigorous, acceptance rates are below 20% and average SSAT scores are above 80%.

# Cheshire Academy

History: Founded as the Episcopal Academy in 1794, the school became the Episcopal Academy Military School in 1862, and the Roxbury School in 1917, before being renamed Cheshire Academy in 1937. Since 2014, the new head, John Nozell, has brought stability to Cheshire after a decade of declining enrollment and financial struggles. The small middle school has been phased out, total enrollment is up by 100 students, and school life has been reinvigorated.

Art major: The Art Major program was created more than a decade ago to support a group of up to a dozen dedicated artists. Although generally reserved for seniors, juniors who show advanced artistic ability may enroll. In the first semester, students create a college art portfolio for National Portfolio Day (a college fair for art schools); the second semester concentrates on preparing pieces for the school’s Art Major show. Several students each year go on to prestigious art schools like the Rhode Island School of Design and the Art Institute of Chicago.

International Curriculum: Cheshire was among the first schools to enroll international boarding students, beginning in the 1850s. Today over 35 different countries are represented and, to maintain diversity, the new head has capped representation from any single foreign country at 10% of the total student body. The school introduced the International Baccalaureate (IB) program in 2011 and expanded the number of IB courses in 2015.

Academic Support: The Roxbury Academic Support Program helps a small number of students improve their performance through one-on-one coaching. Students develop techniques to help with organization, attention, memory, or self-confidence. Different levels of support are available depending on student needs.

Football: Over the past seven season, the foorball team has chalked up an impressive 61-10 record, two Colonial League titles, and four New England Bowl Championships. A number of alumni have gone to compete at the collegiate level, including D1 schools like Penn State, Boston College, Duke, UConn, UNC, and Navy.

# Choate Rosemary Hall
    
Arts Concentration: Choate has an excellent arts program that attracts talented musicians, dancers, actors, and artists. For two out of three terms, students can practice instead of participating in athletics. For example, the music concentration requires courses in music theory, music harmony, and at least two terms of music history. Students are also required to take weekly instrumental or voice lessons. In addition, during terms when students are not involved in athletics, students are expected to practice for two hours every day at least four days per week. Note that interested applicants need to audition or share their portfolio as part of the application process.

Science: Choate’s diverse curriculum includes a Science Research Program and an Environmental Immersion Program.

Global Perspective: Choate Rosemary Hall’s Global Studies program began in 1959 with a tour to Russia.  Study abroad programs now include academic terms in China, France, Italy, Jordan, and Spain. Choate also has an interdisciplinary program in Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies.

Economics: Choate has an extensive economics curriculum. In addition to AP-level macroeconomics and microeconomics courses, electives include development economics, environmental economics, and monetary theory. Choate participates in the National Economics Challenge and has been a finalist (placing in the top four) in 14 out of the last 16 years.

Alumni: Choate’s alumni include John F. Kennedy, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Douglas, Paul Giamatti, Glen Close, and Ivanka Trump. In 2006 and 2010, three members of the Women’s ice hockey team were Choate alumni. In 2016, two Choate alumni were among the thirty-two recipients of the prestigious Rhodes Scholarships.

# Concord Academy

Performing Arts: Concord Academy has excellent dance and theatre programs. They offer several levels of instruction and a Dance and Theater Company. The dance program focuses on formal training in ballet and contemporary dance in a 2,500-square-foot, professional-level dance studio. In addition, there are opportunities to explore jazz, hip-hop, social dance, and African dance forms. The Dance Company has collaborated with Boston’s Institute of Contemporary Art, the Royal College of London, and Eton College in England. In addition to acting, the theatre program offers opportunities to write plays, direct full-scale productions, and design sets, costumes, lighting, and sound.

Athletics: Varsity teams are competitive, and a number of students go on to compete at the college level, but the school doesn’t revolve around sporting events or around student athletes. Concord has a ‘co-curricular requirement’ instead of the typical ‘athletic requirement’ - dance, community service or theatre. Concord offers a wide variety of interscholastic athletic opportunities, but does not have a football team.

Electives: Concord has fewer required courses and a vast array of electives to choose from. For example, history has distributional requirements, but no required classes. Students can take history electives such as Native American History, Islam in South Asia, Early Modern European Revolutions, Gender in Modern America, and Modern American Environmental History. Science & Innovation: In addition to traditional science courses, a number of applied science electives are offered, such as evolutionary biology, applied environmental science, the chemistry of cooking, engineering design, and meteorology. The InSPIRE (Interested Students Pursuing Internship Research Experiences) program helps students find meaningful summer research experiences through alumni and friends of CA. Recently, the new CA Labs doubled the size of the science building.

Student Life: There are three well-integrated groups of students at Concord: boarders, local day students, and students who arrive by train from Boston. Concord had to temporarily close the dorms several years ago during the day and discovered that students became much closer. As a result it became a permanent policy.

The boys’ team has won the title more than 20 times and currently holds several New England records. In boys’ water polo, success is a more recent phenomenon, but the team has been making up for lost time over the past decade. After winning the New England Championship for the first time in 2007, they went on to win in 2008, 2010, and 2011, and they’ve made the semi-finals several times in the past few years.

King’s Academy: The King of Jordan is an alumnus of Deerfield Academy. He thought so highly of the school that he founded King’s Academy in Jordan based on the Deerfield model, and asked the headmaster of Deerfield at the time to become the founding headmaster of King’s Academy. Deerfield offers Arabic, semester and year-abroad opportunities at King’s Academy, and annual trips to Jordan.

Campus: The gothic-style, stone-walled campus at Emma Willard is stunning. It has played a starring role in several movies: The Emperor’s Club, Scent of a Woman, The Age of Innocence, and Ironweed.

Global Opportunities: International students have been welcomed since the school’s founding more than two hundred years ago. International students currently represent approximately 25% of the student boy. As a member of the Round Square network, Emma students can participate in international conferences and exchanges with other schools in the network. Exchange opportunities currently exist with schools in Australia, South Africa, Germany, Argentina, and England.

Traditions: Emma Willard is rich in tradition. Eventide, May Day, Senior Triangle Takeover, Ring Week, Baccalaureate…. Among the many traditions, Revels stands out as perhaps the most cherished. Each year, every member of the senior class takes part in a medieval Christmas performance – a play-within-a-play with singing, dancing, and traditional costumes. Each class makes it their own by adding new characters, but the core of the play was written by the head of English in 1915. The roles are a closely-guarded until the first performance.

Science: Students with interest in scientific research can begin hands-on research projects in ninth grade. In tenth grade, students can work on research projects for a full academic year, guided by faculty members. In junior and senior years, students are matched with mentors at local scientific institutions, such as the Rennsselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). One recent student was a semi-finalist in the prestigious Intel Science Talent Search and secured a patent for her ground-breaking research.

Performing Arts: There are a number of accomplished performing arts ensembles - .Dance Company, Theatre Company, and advanced choral and instrumental ensembles. A handful of dedicated musicians also audition for the Empire State Youth Orchestra, a talented regional youth orchestra. The school can count a number of artists among its alumnae – although Jane Fonda is arguably the most famous, alumnae also include a playwright, professional dancer, documentary filmmaker and Emmy-nominated costume designer.

Overview: Episcopal High School (EHS) is one of a handful of schools that are 100% boarding (others includes St. Paul’s, St. Andrew’s and Woodberry Forest). It is also, as the name suggests, a Christian school, but one that welcomes students from all backgrounds. Students attend Chapel three time per week and all students take a course in Biblical Theology.

DC Location: EHS is less than 10 miles from the White House, and makes the most of its DC location. For example, for the elective course “9/11 to now”, primary research has included visits to the Pentagon to discuss foreign policy decisions with an Army General who commanded forces in Iraq. All students take the 4-year “Washington Program”, which helps students to understand and appreciate Washington’s political structures, geography, economy, and cultural resources. For the past forty years, the program has culminated with a month-long externship.

Leadership and Ethics: At the heart of the  Leadership and Ethics Program is the EHS Honor Code. Since 1857, students have pledged: “I will not lie. I will not cheat. I will not steal. I will report the student who does.” The program helps provide students with an ethical foundation for making important decisions, and the skills required to effectively lead teams of peers. The leadership journey kicks off with The Burch Outdoor program, when the entire freshman class journeys to the Appalachians for a physically and emotionally-demanding, five-day backpacking expedition.

Athletics: EHS has a very strong athletics program - since 2000,  teams have won the independent school state championships in golf, lacrosse, soccer, cross country, and basketball. The football program is benefiting from the arrival of Coach Voulgaris in 2015 – since then, EHS has won the Interstate Athletic Conference twice. The annual football game against Woodberry Forest School is the oldest high school football rivalry in the South, dating back to 1901.

Music: EHS has a large number of music groups: jazz ensemble, rock ‘n’ roll club, two choirs, two ‘a cappella’ groups, and full orchestra. The music department also offers courses in advanced music theory and music recording.

International: International students make up half the student body, with students coming from fifteen or more foreign countries. Four levels of English as a Second Language (ESL) are taught. All students in ESL participate fully in the rest of the curriculum. Teachers provide cross-cultural guidance as an integral part of the program.

Elite Scholars Program: Grier has a broad range of academic abilities. Students with excellent grades and standardized test scores can participate in the Elite Scholars Program, which prepares students for at least five AP courses out of the 21 AP courses which are offered. Elite scholars achieved SAT scores above 2050 and SAT subject scores above 700.

Pre-professional Dance Program: Grier is one of a small number of schools that has a pre-professional dance program. Enrolled dancers attend their academic classes in the morning and spend the remainder of their day, from 12:30-6:30, in the dance studio. During this time, girls take ballet, modern, jazz, and contemporary classes. These dancers also join other students in hip hop, tap, and stretch/strengthening classes.

Visual Art: Many students concentrate in the arts, taking up to three art classes per semester. Classes include AP Art History and over twenty studio art classes in a variety of media. The AP portfolio class allows students to prepare portfolios that they can use for admission to art colleges. Every year, 10-15% of students go on to study at premier visual art colleges and universities. For example, graduates have matriculated at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), the School of Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFA), and the London College of Fashion.

Riding: Grier offers recreational riding and a competitive Varsity riding program, in which girls ride up to five times a week. The 25,000 square foot Equestrian Center includes four barns, two outdoor rings, two heated indoor arenas. The Stables hosts multiple Interscholastic Equestrian Association (IEA) competitions. In order to accommodate all skill levels, the school owns fifty horses. Grier also offers boarding for privately owned horses.

Eighth Grade: Groton is unusual among boarding schools in still having an eighth grade. Every year, competitive is intense for the twenty-four spots in “Form Two”. (The last “Form One” was in the 1960s.)

Affordability: With an admit rate of only 12%, Groton could continue to raise tuition and still fill the school many times over with qualified applicants. However, in 2014, Groton trustees decided to freeze tuition for the next three years. One trustee explained the decision: “Raising tuition has a more important opportunity cost, in the form of a more restricted applicant pool.” Groton’s leadership has sparked discussions around affordability at other boarding schools.

History: Groton has an excellent history curriculum. Critical thinking and essay writing skills are developed through three core courses: Sacred Texts & Ancient Peoples, The World & the West, and U.S. History. Electives explore the history of China, Russia and India, and U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Philippines and Iraq. The Court & Constitution class concludes with a mock Supreme Court trial - a popular event on-campus for more than twenty years. Concord students have had a number of papers published in the prestigious Concord Review, the only quarterly journal to publish history research papers by high school students.

Science: A broad set of science courses includes Cosmology, Ecology, Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Human Physiology, and Renewable Energy. Organic Chemistry is taught by Temba Maqubela, headmaster, inspirational teacher and former head of Chemistry at Andover. A recent addition to Groton’s Schoolhouse building added 20,000 square feet for state-of-the-art STEM classrooms, labs and a fabrications lab with 3D printers.

Music:  Time for practice and ensemble rehearsals is built into each student’s daytime schedule so that students do not need to choose between a music and other activities. In addition to regular recitals and concerts, performance opportunities include a Parents Weekend concert, the annual Jazz Festival, and weekly Chapel services. Every December since 1919, the superb Choir has performed three Services of Nine Lessons and Carols which attract nearly 1000 listeners each year.

The Great Outdoors: Holderness offers plenty of opportunities to get outside and experience the White Mountains. New students are introduced to the White Mountains as soon as they arrive - the school year begins with an overnight camping trip. In addition to the skiing that Holderness is best known for, students can get involved in mountaineering, mountain biking, and rock climbing. Junior year includes a challenging, ten-day winter camping experience that teaches leadership, team-building, and wilderness survival skills.

Snow sports: About half the school takes part in alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, snowboarding, or ski junping. While some schools have world-class skiing programs or college prep academic programs, Holderness is unusual in combining both. The head of school, Phil Peck, reflects this dual emphasis – he’s a graduate of Dartmouth and Columbia and a former World Cup and Olympic ski coach. Since 1940, Holderness School has produced 17 Olympic athletes, and 38 National Team members.

Facilities: The campus includes a new hockey rink, eight tennis courts, two basketball courts and extensive playing fields. Off-campus, the ski resorts of Cannon, Mittersill, and Waterville Valley are 30 minutes away, and Loon Mountain is only 45 minutes by car.

College Placement: Not surprisingly, many students end up at colleges or universities near the mountains, including colleges with strong D1 ski programs, such as Dartmouth, Colby, St. Lawrence, and Williams.

Science: The emphasis on the outdoors extends into the science curriculum. In addition to standard science courses, students can take Snow Science, which covers avalanche formation and snow metamorphism, and AP Environmental Science.

Arts: Not everything at Holderness revolves around outdoor activities. There are many opportunities to get involved in art, theatre, and music. For example, students participate annually in the national poetry recitation contest. In addition, working artists from all over the country are invited to Holderness for a ten-day program called Artward Bound every year. The artists work closely with and perform alongside students and faculty.

Pre-Engineering Program: This successful program has been running for more than a decade. Kent students are exposed to the engineering profession through engineering coursework, robotics competitions, guest lectures, and field trips (e.g., to the engine firm Pratt & Whitney). It’s known as a program that’s demanding and fun. According to the Director of the program: “It’s like a playground for the students. They love being hands-on and learning teamwork with any kind of challenge. They get locked in.”

Rowing: Kent’s has a long, illustrious rowing history. They won the gold medal in first New England championship in 1947 and have finished first twenty-five times since, most recently in 2015. The river is only a couple of minutes’ walk from the dorms and the indoor facilities are excellent – including thirty ergometers and a six-person indoor rowing tank. The race season includes the Head of the Charles, the Youth Nationals, and the Henley Regatta in England. Alumni frequently row in college – one of Kent’s alumnae rowed in Canadian Women’s Olympic Eight in Rio.

Riding: Kent welcomes rides of all levels. Kent’s excellent facilities include two indoor and three outdoor rings, a Grand Prix field, a grass hunter field, and a cross-country course. In addition to world-class riding training, veterinary care, nutritional needs, and conditioning are also taught. The Equestrian program is run by Michael Page – three-time Olympic medal winner, coach to U.S. and Canadian 3-day teams, and seven-time judge at the National Equitation Finals.

Entrepreneurship & Finance: To learn more about finance, students can gain financial literacy through a five-part Sunday lecture series and participate in the Wharton Investment Competition, making use of the on-campus Bloomberg terminal. In addition, a number of budding entrepreneurs have started their own businesses at Kent – for example, a delivery service for students.

Location: The setting of Kimball Union (KUA) is picture postcard New England – the Georgian-style building sit at the crest of a hill. KUA, often referred to as ‘The Hilltop’, is less than twenty minutes’ drive from Dartmouth College, and about two hours’ drive from Boston. There isn’t too much happening in Meriden beyond the school, but Hanover, the home of the Dartmouth College, has a movie theatre and a performing arts center that hosts artists from all over the world.

Hands-on Learning: KUA has a week-long program, K-term, when students and faculty participate in hands-on learning projects that might not otherwise be possible in the classroom. Recent examples include a cultural exchange trip to Cuba, local community service projects, and a deep investigation of Moby Dick through visits to Mystic, CT and Nantucket, MA. The goal is to allow students to investigate their passions or new areas of interest in an authentic manner.

STEM: The STEM impact team works on utilizes STEM tools and technology to solve issues that impact society. For example, the team conducted a project to help identify dangerous, invasive aquatic plants in New Hampshire. The team created a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to help conduct the research.

Environmental Program: KUA has a goal of producing 30% of its electricity onsite from renewable resources. The school installed a 5-kilowatt wind turbine and a photovoltaic array. The wind turbine was made possible by a senior capstone project which created the site design and petitioned for the necessary permits. Students have grown vegetables, bred tilapia, and reared pigs, with the goal of connecting students to food sources and reducing food waste.

College-level Coaching: KUA has a number of college-level coaches. The assistant coach for girls’ hockey and lacrosse came from Union College, the alpine ski coach and women’s hockey coach joined from Dartmouth, and the men’s soccer coach was head coach at Colgate for 20 years. As one coach explained: “Playing at the college level is a big jump for most students. In high school, you can help instill the work ethic to become a college athlete.”

Head of School Symposium: Every year, the head of school chooses a topic for the community to explore together. When the topic was immigration and emigration, guest speakers included a professor of international relations at NYU and there was spring break trip to Ireland. When the topic was the Caribbean, guest speakers included the founder of a cross-cultural training center in the Dominican Republic, and there was a spring break trip to the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Houses: Hogwarts has Gryffindor,  Hufflepuff,  Ravenclaw  and  Slytherin. LFA has Bird, Lewis, Sargent, or Welch. Every student belongs to one of these houses, and competes for the House Cup throughout the year. Students earn points for their House through academic accomplishments, supporting athletic teams, performing random acts of kindness, or participating in one of the many House competitions, such as the campus-wide scavenger hunt.

Global Perspectiveh: LFA likes to say that it has a midwestern heart and global mind. Courses include Global Economics, Global Literacies, AP World History, and Comparative Indigenous Histories. Several courses contain a travel component. AP Environmental Science students travel to a conservation ecosystem like Puerto Rico to promote biodiversity and environmental sustainability. Advanced French students can stay with families in a remote mountain village in Morroco. ‘Contemporary Civilization of Latin America’  students live with indigenous families in Peru.

Traditions: Sports teams ring the Bowditch bell when they return to campus with a victory in hand. Other traditions include Move-Up day, an end-of-year ceremony carried over from Ferry Hall. The academy’s athletic teams are known as the Caxys – a nick-name adopted in the 1900s that refers to a sound frogs make in a Greek comedy by Aristophanes.

Athletics: Lake Forest Academy is the only high school in the state of Illinois with its own ice rink on campus. There are three hockey teams at LFA – a Prep team, Men’s Varsity, and Ladies’ Varsity. Prep hockey is a two-season sport at LFA, and runs from August through February.

Inter-disciplinary Course: In 2013, following a curriculum review, Mercersburg started to offer seniors a number of inter-disciplinary Springboard courses. The current course line-up is: Business of Sports, Art and Business of Graphic Design, Education Across Borders, Entrepreneurship, Global Food Chain, Maker’s Lab, Parallel Histories, and  Rapid Application Development.

Senior Research Project: Students enrolled in MAPS (Mercersburg’s Advanced Program for Global Studies) have to fulfill ravel, language, community service and research requirements. The research requirement is a 40-50 page thesis paper on a global issue. Students make connections with experts in their field of study outside of campus. Students also make an actionable proposal based on the thesis, and a presentation of the thesis to a panel.

Athletics: The Athletics program scores well in terms of breadth of participation and depth of achievement. More than eighty percent of students participate in the athletics program. 20-25% of each graduating class typically competes at the collegiate level. Mercersburg can count 54 Olympians among its alumni, representing 14 countries and collecting 20 medals. Students compete at a high level in many sports, but achievements in swimming and track & field stand out. Swimmers can train all three seasons during the school year. Mercersburg currently has a nine-lane 25-yard pool, and is planning a new 40,000-square-foot aquatic center with a 50-meter, Olympic size pool. In addition, there is a six-lane outdoor track, and a recently built in-door competition-level indoor facility.

Arts: Mercersburg has a broad array of performing and visual art classes, including dance, stagecraft, music recording, and digital photography and video. The Performing Arts Center houses a 600-seat main theatre, a 120-seat studio theatre, dance and art studios, rehearsal rooms, and recording facilities. When this impressive facility opened in 2006, it was christened with performances by violinist Itzhak Perlman and members of the New York City ballet.

English: Excellence in writing is central to the Middlesex curriculum. Every sophomore student takes the Writer’s Workshop – a weekly seminar that provides students with a strong foundation in writing, allowing them to write in a clear, fluid style. Students continue with the course until they have passed a writing test, a grammar test, and a punctuation test. Senior-year electives include medieval literature, African-American literature, nineteenth-century British literature, and modern American poetry.

Athletics: Middlesex belongs to the highly-competitive Independent School League (ISL). One of the most successful teams has been the varsity Lacrosse team, which has won more than 10 ISL championships. Another area of strength is alpine skiing. The season starts with a rigorous dry-land training program until there is snow on the ground at nearby Nashoba Valley. The team competes every week at Nashoba, and goes on regular training trips to larger mountains The girl’s team has won the New England (NEPSAC) class B championship, and the boys’ ski team has won six ISL championships in a row and. Many Middlesex students have gone on to ski and play lacrosse at the collegiate level.

Community Service: Middlesex students engage in a broad range of community service activities. Almost a third of the junior class participates in a 13-week program that teaches students about philanthropy. There are multiple opportunities to go on community service trips, including an annual trip to South Africa which works with children in a Cape Town orphanage.

Arts: Middlesex believes that school is a time to discover previously unknown talents. To this end, all students take four half-credit ‘Elements of Style’ courses in music, theatre, studio art and art history. These courses develop a common, foundational level of practical skills and critical judgment. On-stage or behind-the-stage, nearly 100 students participate in theatre productions. Following the close of a major capital campaign, Middlesex is upgrading its arts facilities. The theatre is being expanded, and a major new music building is being built, with rehearsal space, a recital hall, a recording studio, and a music library.

Headmaster: The chairman of the Board of Trustees describes Drew Casertano as a “visionary leader”, an alumna says he “cares about everything on campus”, and a parent notes that he “embodies the core beliefs of the school”. Over the past 25 years, the head of Millbrook has transformed the school while sustaining its core values. Enrollment has grown from 170 students, the applicant pool has tripled, and many new facilities have been built. Casertano says he is proudest of having restored the alumni’s pride in the school.

Community service: Millbrook puts a high value on community service – for example, every year a senior is awarded the Community Service Cup in recognition of an outstanding contribution. Each incoming freshman is required to rotate through the three main community service requirements: recycling, the community garden and the Trevor Zoo. Upper classmen devote half an hour four times a week to one of the community projects, and many volunteer for additional service projects.

Arts: Each semester, eighty percent of Millbrook’s students take one of more than twenty-five different art courses in the stunning new arts center. The advanced art history program has an innovative immersion approach. Having studied one artist in-depth throughout the year, curate an exhibition of the artist’s work Past artists include Willem de Kooning and Frank Lloyd Wright. Athletic Alternatives: Many students play team sports all three seasons, and a number go on to play at the collegiate level, especially in ice hockey, field hockey and lacrosse. However, there are several alternatives to team sports, such as dance, horseback riding, and theater. An option you won’t find anywhere else is “zoo squad”, as Millbrook is the only high school in the country with a zoo. The Trevor Zoo is dedicated to environmental education and to conservation of endangered species. The zoo squad works on a variety of tasks, from feeding animals to renovating exhibits.

Environmental Stewardship: Millbrook has the ambitious goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2020. A major step towards this was the installation of a 7-acre field of solar panels, which provides 100% of the school’s electricity. In addition, many of the buildings have geothermal heating and cooling systems.

Campus: Milton Academy is located about eight miles outside Boston on a beautiful suburban campus. Proximity to Boston provides opportunities for academic enrichment and social events. Students can visit the labs at MIT and the Museum of Fine Arts. Talented musicians can audition for the New England Conservatory and Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras. Then, at the weekends, you can take in a show or enjoy dim sum in Chinatown.

Student body: Roughly half the upper schools students and half are day students. (More than half the upper school day students previously attended Milton’s middle school.) Many applicants wonder if there’s a day / boarder divide. Students at the school say it’s a non-issue – day students stay for after-school activities, and many stay for dinner as well.

Academics: Milton excels in many disciplines, but English courses are especially well regarded. (After all, Milton counts T.S. Elliott as an alumnus.) A focus on excellent writing pervades the curriculum – in Science papers as well as in English essays. As freshman, all students attend a weekly grammar-intensive writing workshop, in addition to their regular English class. A highlight of the English curriculum is the creative writing class. Students have high praise for the course. One student described how the course “completely changed my viewpoint on the art of creative writing”. Another told how the teacher and published poet, Jim Connolly, brings the best out of students: “He tells us to be ambitious in our writing…. He pushes us to go outside of ourselves.”

Achievements: Milton students can boast of some impressive achievements. In the Massachusetts Scholastic Writing Awards, Milton has the most gold medal winners (top 5%) in the past three years. Jazz combos have won awards in a number of competitions, including the Berklee High School Jazz Festival. In athletics, the soccer teams stand out – both the girls and boys teams have won the ISL championship and the New England Championship in recent years.

Admission: The average SSAT score of accepted students is at the 90th percentile. In 2017, they received more than 1,600 applications for less than 150 places.

Traditions: Porter’s most well-known alumnae Jacqueline Kennedy, who attended from XX to XX. At the time, the school had a “convent-like rigor” and it was regarded as the preeminent “finishing school” for the daughters of the New England elite. Although much has changed, Porter’s keeps the old traditions alive – the current head, Kate Windsor, believe that they unite the community and link current students to past and future students. Traditions include the Old Girl, New Girl pairing, the Circle of Light, Singing in the Garden, the Ring Ceremony, the Little Meeting and Mountain Day.

Leadership: Students receive formal leadership training through a series of progressive seminars. Freshman year begins with a focus on self-awareness and decision making to establish personal growth. Sophomore and junior years emphasize concepts of problem solving, teamwork, and competency; innovation and strategic planning are the hallmarks of senior year. Porter’s Leadership Program also offers formal trainings to elected student leaders and serves as a resource for all students and faculty working on a variety of goals, projects or initiatives. “We expect our students to take their place as prominent leaders within the global community.’” - Associate Director of Admission, Class Dean.

Dance: Porter's offers Ballet, Jazz and Modern Dance as the technical base for the Dance program, with elective classes offered in improvisation, Pilates body conditioning, Hip Hop and African dance, as well as other styles and techniques. Advanced students may audition for our student dance company, which is a commitment of 10-12 hours per week. Each year the company holds three performances in the Gaines Dance Barn, a large-scale performance in the Hacker Theater and a number of off-campus performances. A number of alumnae are dance majors or minors, or participate in college dance companies.

Earth Club: This student-run environmental group is active on-campus. The group coordinates and promotes Earth Week each April, and is engaged in a number of projects throughout the year, e.g., selling reusable organic cotton shopping bags to raise funds for a community garden. Fifteen students attended the 2015 People’s Climate March in New York.

Location: The New Hampton campus occupies three hundred and forty acres is in the foothills of the White Mountains in New Hampshire, one hundred miles north of Boston. The school overlooks a small pond where students can swim in summer and ice skate in winter.

International Baccalaureate (IB): New Hampton’s mission is “to cultivate lifelong learners who will serve as active global citizens”. Supporting that mission, NHS was the first boarding school in New England to offer the IB. 35% of students pursue the full IB diploma, and 75% of students take at least one IB class. IB classes are offered to juniors and seniors. New Hampton’s Director of Studies explains the benefits: “The International Baccalaureate fundamentally changes the goals of education. Rather than asking students what they know, IB asks what can they do? It encourages students to investigate the subject, not just the subject’s content.”

Basketball: The basketball program attracts top players from across the U.S. and from overseas. Despite playing in a highly competitive league, which includes Brewster Academy and Tilton School, the Huskies have maintained a winning record above 70% over the past few years. Alumni have gone on to play at basketball powers houses like Syracuse, Indiana, and Xavier University. Several have been picked in the NBA draft, and others have made basketball their career as D1 coaches or working with NBA organizations in a variety of roles.

Skiing: The ski team trains at nearby Loon Mountain and ski season typically starts immediately after Thanksgiving and ends in March. The school also has a “freeski” team that skis on moguls and in the terrain park at Loon. The snowboarding team travel to Waterville Valley or Cannon Mountain. Recreational skiers, including beginners, can ski at the Ragged Mountain Resort, a smaller mountain which is only 25 minutes from campus.

Science: In addition to the standard courses, New Hampton has an interesting range of science electives, including sports medicine, agroecology, environmental studies, introduction to engineering, and robotics. A new math, science, and engineering center was built in 2009.

The Academies: Phillips Academy Andover and Phillips Exeter Academy (profile on the following page) share many characteristics. Both were founded by the Phillips family, both are large boarding schools with outstanding facilities, both offer generous financial aid, and both have sustained reputations for academic excellence for over two hundred years. Although one could argue that Exeter has the edge in science and math, and Andover has the edge in humanities, both offer incredible breadth and depth across all academic subjects.

Clusters: Andover is several times larger than many boarding schools (more than three times the size of Groton, for example). To create smaller communities within a large school, each student is assigned to one of five clusters: Abbott, Flagstaff, Pine Knoll, West Quad North, and West Quad South. Most students stay within one cluster during their time at the school. Each cluster has a Dean, a student President, Proctors, and Prefects. Each has its distinctive traditions.

Debate Club: The Philomathean Society is the oldest high school debate club in the United States. The team has been meeting in the Debate Room at Bulfinch Hall since it was established in 1825. The team consistently performs well in debates tournaments and the Andover Invitational Debate Tournament is the largest regional debate tournament. Phillipians regularly qualify for the prestigious World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships.

Languages: Andover has a broad range of languages and many study abroad options. Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Latin, French, German, Japanese, Russian and Spanish are offered. In 1964, Andover founded the School Year Abroad (SYA), which offers opportunities to study in Italy, Spain, France, and China. The organization now has over forty member schools.

Athletics: Andover fields strong teams in many sports. The girls’ hockey team, the girls’ volley ball team, the boys’ swim team and the boys’ crew team have won the New England championships several times in recent years. Andover’s alumni include thirty-two Olympians – one of whom, Caroline Lind, won gold in 2008 and 2012 in the women’s eight.

Harkness: Exeter is known for its use of the Harkness method, a Socratic approach that emphasizes dialogue and enquiry. Groups of twelve students sit around an oval table, with discussions facilitated by the teacher. Harkness discussion is typically 40- 60% of the class grade. Many schools now use the Harkness approach, but most use it mainly in the humanities.

Mathematics: Exeter uses Harkness for all subjects, including math. So, what does a typical class look like? Each student comes to class with their answers to the assigned problem sets. When they arrive, students put an answer to one of the problems up on the board. The author then presents their solution and a discussion ensues. Although most find the approach more engaging than traditional methods, and value the problem-solving skills that it develops, some find the approach frustrating at first.

Clubs: Exeter has 90 clubs and organizations. Dramat gives students the chance to write, produce and act in small theater productions, WPEA is a student-run radio station, and the Exeter Surf Club takes advantage of Exeter’s proximity to the beach. The Exeter Political Union coordinates campus political groups and hosts politicians. Many of the presidential candidates visit Exeter, helped by their location in the first primary state.

Athletics: Exeter fields over sixty interscholastic teams across a wide range of sports. Exeter has enjoyed especially strong success in cross country and crew. The cross country has won five New England championships in recent years and the girls’ rowing team has won the New England title more than ten times since 2002.

Library: Exeter’s library was designed by the world-renowned architect Louis Kahn. The atrium is spectacular and the building was described as a “modern architectural masterpiece” by the American Institute of Architects. It houses 138,000 print volumes, making it the largest secondary school library in the world.

Endowment: Exeter’s endowment exceeds $1 billion, and its endowment per student is $1 million. This allows the school to provide excellent facilities and the latest technology, but is also allows Exeter to pay the full cost of tuition for any family whose income is below $75,000.

-   SSAT by Christa Abbott explain the math concepts very clearly
    
-   “Pre-algebra”, published by the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) is excellent for an in-depth treatment of exponents and roots.
    
-   The upper level SSAT has questions on the Triangle Inequality Theorem and Euler paths. Both are simpler than the names suggest, but are not covered in most prep books. Khan Academy has a video on the former, and the PatrickJMT website has a video on the latter.
