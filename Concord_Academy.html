<p><strong>Performing Arts</strong>: Concord Academy has excellent dance and theatre programs. They offer several levels of instruction and a Dance and Theater Company. The dance program focuses on formal training in ballet and contemporary dance in a 2,500-square-foot, professional-level dance studio. In addition, there are opportunities to explore jazz, hip-hop, social dance, and African dance forms. The Dance Company has collaborated with Boston’s Institute of Contemporary Art, the Royal College of London, and Eton College in England. In addition to acting, the theatre program offers opportunities to write plays, direct full-scale productions, and design sets, costumes, lighting, and sound.</p>
<p><strong>Athletics</strong>: Varsity teams are competitive, and a number of students go on to compete at the college level, but the school doesn’t revolve around sporting events or around student athletes. Concord has a ‘co-curricular requirement’ instead of the typical ‘athletic requirement’ - dance, community service or theatre. Concord offers a wide variety of interscholastic athletic opportunities, but does not have a football team.</p>
<p><strong>Electives</strong>: Concord has fewer required courses and a vast array of electives to choose from. For example, history has distributional requirements, but no required classes. Students can take history electives such as Native American History, Islam in South Asia, Early Modern European Revolutions, Gender in Modern America, and Modern American Environmental History. Science &amp; Innovation: In addition to traditional science courses, a number of applied science electives are offered, such as evolutionary biology, applied environmental science, the chemistry of cooking, engineering design, and meteorology. The InSPIRE (Interested Students Pursuing Internship Research Experiences) program helps students find meaningful summer research experiences through alumni and friends of CA. Recently, the new CA Labs doubled the size of the science building.</p>
<p><strong>Student Life</strong>: There are three well-integrated groups of students at Concord: boarders, local day students, and students who arrive by train from Boston. Concord had to temporarily close the dorms several years ago during the day and discovered that students became much closer. As a result it became a permanent policy.</p>
